## FAQs
### What will the fee be?
The fee will be 5%.

### Where are the full terms of the staking service?
These will be added before the deadline to submit keys. If this is important to you, please wait before submitting your information for the Genesis ledger.

### Can I un-delegate my stake?
Yes, you can un-delegate at any time. There is no penalty to do so - either submit a delegation transaction with the new staking service or back to yourself if you wish to be a block producer. There is a delay of 1-2 epochs before any updates are made, and if staking from Genesis the first two epochs will use the Genesis ledger.

### How often are payouts made?
This is yet to be determined. Ideally, after every block produced (once confirmed), but this will largely depend on the initial state of mainnet at launch and specifically transaction fees. A safer assumption may be once at the end of the epoch but we will need to assess conditions to fully determine this.

### How are payments calculated?
We have a work in progress draft of our pool payment mechanism here. This takes into account the effect of the supercharged coinbase rewards to fairly distribute to all delegates. This may be updated prior to launch following peer review.
